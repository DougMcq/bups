With my novice Shipwright skills the only practical approach was a project boat requiring less than a full overhaul.. So for two years I drove my wife around the northeast looking at boats for sale (and almost drove her crazy, as well). </p><div id="h.p_zLR9Ey1UoMQq" class="CobnVe aP9Z7e"></div><h2 id="h.p_zLR9Ey1UoMQq_l" dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q JYVBee" tabindex="-1"><div jscontroller="Ae65rd" jsaction="touchstart:UrsOsc; click:KjsqPd; focusout:QZoaZ; mouseover:y0pDld; mouseout:dq0hvd;fv1Rjc:jbFSOd;CrfLRd:SzACGe;" class="CjVfdc"><div class="PPhIP rviiZ" jsname="haAclf"><br/></div>TODAY MINUS FIVE YEARS  </div></h2><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">Purchase made! Long story short, While I continue to learn, I must admit that each step has been a character-building (aka humbling) experience.

I started the usual way with Google, eBay, and Craigslist - each had their quirks at the time. But with a highly fragmented market, I had to resort to repetitive Google searches. In other words, searching over &amp; over my list of "good" sites in order to find “fresh” inventory. </p><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">This approach turned out to be neither efficient nor effective. Inefficient because I spent a lot of time to purchase a few, but necessary, parts. Ineffective because I would have had to discover additional one-of-kind parts and make a purchase decision before the next guy (or gal) because these are often one-of-a-kind items AND the good deals don't last!  </p><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">With +40 years of software development experience, I thought I could come up with a solution where I could spend more time doing boat restoration and less time searching.  </p><div id="h.p_tlav6qVYoMQ2" class="CobnVe aP9Z7e"></div><h2 id="h.p_tlav6qVYoMQ2_l" dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q JYVBee" tabindex="-1"><div jscontroller="Ae65rd" jsaction="touchstart:UrsOsc; click:KjsqPd; focusout:QZoaZ; mouseover:y0pDld; mouseout:dq0hvd;fv1Rjc:jbFSOd;CrfLRd:SzACGe;" class="CjVfdc"><div class="PPhIP rviiZ" jsname="haAclf"><br/></div>TODAY MINUS ONE YEAR </div></h2><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">The BUPS system, after a few "false starts" is performing well. I'm pleasantly surprised as to how well the BUPS system is meeting my needs. I realize that with incremental time and money I can make the system publicly available to benefit other boaters.</p><div id="h.p_7ixdz13noMQ4" class="CobnVe aP9Z7e"></div><h2 id="h.p_7ixdz13noMQ4_l" dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q JYVBee" tabindex="-1"><div jscontroller="Ae65rd" jsaction="touchstart:UrsOsc; click:KjsqPd; focusout:QZoaZ; mouseover:y0pDld; mouseout:dq0hvd;fv1Rjc:jbFSOd;CrfLRd:SzACGe;" class="CjVfdc"><div class="PPhIP rviiZ" jsname="haAclf"><br/></div>SINCE THEN </div></h2><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">BUPS has assisted thousands of boaters in locating used parts. Meanwhile, I have been adding sites for inventory collection in order to make BUPS more useful for both I and others. In addition, I have been making small enhancements in response to user feedback. Lastly, I have been assisting individuals with constructing effective searches, This has been instrumental in understanding the existing system's shortcomings.</p><div id="h.p_pb0tAHg2oMQ4" class="CobnVe aP9Z7e"></div><h2 id="h.p_pb0tAHg2oMQ4_l" dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q JYVBee" tabindex="-1"><div jscontroller="Ae65rd" jsaction="touchstart:UrsOsc; click:KjsqPd; focusout:QZoaZ; mouseover:y0pDld; mouseout:dq0hvd;fv1Rjc:jbFSOd;CrfLRd:SzACGe;" class="CjVfdc"><div class="PPhIP rviiZ" jsname="haAclf"><br/></div>TODAY </div></h2><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">BUPS currently operates a a free search service for US boaters. In other words, I set up the search requests after consultation with a boat owner. Initially a search is made against  100,000-200,000 recent listings . An alert email is sent even if there are zero matches the first time. On a daily basis your search is repeated for “fresh” inventory (10,000-20,000 items are added &amp; deleted daily). But, you will get emails only when matches are found. </p><div id="h.p_rXyp5BD8oMRB" class="CobnVe aP9Z7e"></div><h2 id="h.p_rXyp5BD8oMRB_l" dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q JYVBee" tabindex="-1"><div jscontroller="Ae65rd" jsaction="touchstart:UrsOsc; click:KjsqPd; focusout:QZoaZ; mouseover:y0pDld; mouseout:dq0hvd;fv1Rjc:jbFSOd;CrfLRd:SzACGe;" class="CjVfdc"><div class="PPhIP rviiZ" jsname="haAclf"><br/></div>IN RETROSPECT</div></h2><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">All in all it has been a rewarding experience as I have met many interesting and knowledgeable people, and also get to participate in wooden boat shows, etc. In addition, as intended, I have learned (sometimes the hard way) about the tools, techniques &amp; materials utilized in traditional boat building. Fortunately, with BUPS handling the parts-finding end of the project, I have more time to devote to both learning and doing.</p><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">For additional background information on this project , please refer to the press page.</p><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">Regards,</p><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q">Doug McQuilken</p><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q"><span class=" aw5Odc" style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="XqQF9c" href="mailto:info@BoatUsedPartSearch.com" target="_blank">info@BoatUsedPartSearch.com</a></span></p><p dir="ltr" class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q"> </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section>`
